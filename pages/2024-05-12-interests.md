# Interests 

As a classically trained chemical engineer and computational scientist, I am interested in applying mathematics to solve systems design problems. Inverse design of systems based on the interpretation of data or lack thereof pique my curiosity. Applications in the field of pharmaceuticals and sustainability, with a focus on process automation are my focus areas.


## Complex data visualization

I enjoy visualizing and interpreting complex data. As an example, consider the following Jupyter Notebooks which contain a selection of data that I visualized for my paper titled [Learning and optimization under epistemic uncertainty with Bayesian hybrid models](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0098135423003009).

* [Epistemic vs aleatoric uncertainty using cannonball example](https://github.com/otherelvis/bayesian-hm/blob/main/cannonball_genExpt_Figs_only-v_job_talk.ipynb)
* [Latin hypercube sampled experiments for model calibration](https://github.com/otherelvis/bayesian-hm/blob/main/cannonball_genExpt_Figs_only.ipynb)
* [Uncertainty based model exploration](https://github.com/otherelvis/bayesian-hm/blob/main/prediction_uncertainty_analysis_v1_aiche21_presentation_figures.ipynb)
* [Error comparison across model architectures](https://github.com/otherelvis/bayesian-hm/blob/main/sequential_hybrid_data_analysis.ipynb)
