## Professional Experience
### Senior Scientist, Computational Process Design and Optimization
#### Pfizer Worldwide Research, Development, and Medicine
Groton, CT, USA (July 2022 - June 2025)
_Drove computational initiatives for the process engineering of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) synthesis across laboratory and manufacturing environments._
* Leveraged data via dynamic models using first principles and machine learning to scale-up API synthesis from laboratory to manufacturing resulting in 20% faster timelines.
* Defined advanced temperature control strategies based on data analytics with nonlinear and mixed integer programming to limit impurities below 1.5% during commercial manufacturing.
* Commissioned a prototype continuous reactor utilising data driven insights for troubleshooting and risk aversion which enabled 30% faster deployment.
* Accelerated process design using innovations in data science via Bayesian optimization, physics informed-machine learning, and mathematical programming.

### Research Assistant 
#### Dowling Lab, University of Notre Dame
Notre Dame, IN (July 2017 - May 2022)
_Led four projects from concept to completion, delivering innovation in data-driven process engineering for the multiscale design of cutting-edge sustainable technologies._
* Created a novel framework for data-driven decision-making under uncertainty using Bayesian statistical models which use machine learning to determine unknown process dynamics, reducing data requirements at least 50%.
* Designed novel flowsheets and filter fabrication techniques by analysing data from 1000s of optimised designs to use membranes for lithium-ion battery recycling, accelerating workflows by 5x
* Grew the group from four to 15+ members and mentored the team to win two grants and publish four articles.
* Proposed integrated vision of data science to revolutionize molecular-to-systems engineering.

### Senior Process Engineer 
#### Simon India Limited 
New Delhi, India (September 2012 - May 2017)
_Drove process engineering and optimisation for industrial projects as the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) consultant for large-scale chemical plants, ensuring on-time delivery of process enhancement and revenue growth._
* Designed (detailed engineering), supervised construction, and commissioned a 2000 metric ton per day sulphuric acid plant with heat recovery system and captive power plant, the first of its kind in India.
* Collaborated with project management to increase project revenue by 17% through contract change-orders.
* Ensured safety compliance as a member of the hazard and operability (HAZOP) studies team for three plants.
* Certified quality compliance for subcontracted units like turbine driven pumps and distributed control systems (DCS).
* Delivered design documents such as P&IDs, PFDs, equipment and instrumentation specifications, and control logics within stipulated deadlines.
* Calculated line hydraulics, equipment sizes, and mass and energy balances for the main plant and offsite utilities.
* Partnered with customers through technical discussions and site visits to build long-term relationships which lead to winning additional contracts.
