## Research Experience
### Senior Scientist, Computational Process Design and Optimization
#### Pfizer Worldwide Research, Development, and Medicine
Groton, CT (July 2022 - current)
*  Developing dynamic models using first-principles and sparse machine learning for active pharmaceutical ingredient synthesis across the laboratory to manufacturing scales.
*  Investigating artificial intelligence for automated and self-optimizing experimentation.
*  Augmenting decision-making for economic resource management using optimal experiment design.
*  Key research tools include Bayesian optimization, gray-box hybrid modeling, machine learning, probabilistic programming, nonlinear programming, and model-based design of experiments.

### Graduate Research Assistant 
#### Dowling Lab, University of Notre Dame
Notre Dame, IN (July 2017 - May 2022)
* Created a framework for data-driven decision-making under model-form uncertainty based on gray-box Bayesian hybrid models (BHM).
* Demonstrated that novel polymer membranes are promising for the sustainable recovery of lithium using predictive mathematical models for structure property relationships, superstructure optimization for system design, and nonlinear parameter estimation to define transport phenomena.
* Proposed integrated vision of data science to revolutionize molecular-to-systems engineering.
* Directly mentored 1 graduate student and 1 undergraduate researcher resulting in 2 journal articles and 1 successful
fellowship grant.

## Professional Experience
### Senior Process Engineer 
#### Simon India Limited 
New Delhi, India (Sep 2012 - May 2017)
* Designed (detailed engineering), supervised construction, and commissioned a 2000 metric ton per day sulphuric acid plant with heat recovery system, the first of its kind, at Paradeep Phosphates Ltd., Odisha, India.
* Increased project revenue by 17% by compiling technical documentation for change-order negotiations.
* Negotiated technical issues with client and licensor and served as the junior technical liaison for the caprolactam distillation project at Gujarat State Fertilizer Corporation, Gujarat, India.
* Demonstrated technical mastery and attention to detail as a part of several teams responsible for hazard and operability (HAZOP) studies of the plant as well as factory and site acceptance tests of critical plant subsystems.
