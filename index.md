I am a computational scientist and chemical engineer who enjoys leveraging data to make better decisions and accelerate workflows through automation. I am adept at Python having worked with it for the past 9 years. Prior to that I worked as a Process Engineer designing and building chemical plants. In my ideal job, I will use AI/ML to accelarate plant design, construction, and commissioning, as this combines all the experience I have gained in my career.

Here's my [resume](pages/resume.md) and my [CV.](pages/cv.md)
